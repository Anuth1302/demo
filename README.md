Requirements:
1. Product Carousel Section:
    ○ Fetch product images from an API (e.g., Unsplash API or Lorem Picsum API)
    and display them in a carousel.
    ○ The carousel should include:
          ■ A large main product image at the top.
          ■ A row of thumbnail images below the main image.
          ■ When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the main image should update
          accordingly.
          ■ Include left and right arrows to navigate through the images.
    ○ Ensure the carousel is responsive, adapting to mobile devices with touch/swipe
    functionality.
2. API Integration:
    ○ Use a free API like Unsplash or Lorem Picsum to fetch product images.
    ○ Make an asynchronous API call to retrieve a set of images when the page
    loads.
    ○ Populate the carousel and thumbnails dynamically with the fetched images.
3. Product Information Section:
    ○ Show static product details including name, price, description, and a variant
    selector (e.g., dropdown or radio buttons for size or color).
    ○ Add an "Add to Cart" button. When clicked, display a confirmation message.
    ○ Include a quantity selector for users to choose the number of products.
